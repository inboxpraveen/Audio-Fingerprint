AudioFingerprint is a production-ready, local audio fingerprinting and song identification system inspired by Shazam and Google Sound Search. It uses spectral peak extraction and combinatorial hashing to identify songs from short audio clips in milliseconds, with a clean Python + Flask architecture suitable for real-world deployments.
